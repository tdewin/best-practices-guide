# Encryption

## Overview

The encryption technology in Veeam Backup & Replication allows you to protect data both while it is in transfer between backup infrastructure components and at rest, when it stored at its final destination. This can be disk, tape or a cloud repository. Customers can use one of the encryption methods or a combination of both to protect against unauthorized access to important data through all steps in the data protection chain.

Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager additionally provides the Password Loss
Protection option that allows authorized Veeam users to recover data from the
backup even if the password is lost. If the password gets lost, the backup
server will provide a challenge key for Enterprise Manager. Using asymmetric
encryption with a public/private key pair, Enterprise Manager generates a
response which the backup server can use for unlocking the backup file without
having the password available.

The encryption algorithms used are industry standard in all cases, leveraging
AES-256 and public key encryption methods. The User Guide provides detailed
information on the encryption algorithms and standards used by the product.

The following sections describe encryption options available in the product,
what they protect, when they should be used and best practices for their use.

## Backup and Backup Copy Job Encryption

### What does it do?

Backup and backup copy job encryption is designed to protect data at rest. These settings protect data if an authorized user gets access to backup files outside of the backup infrastructure. Authorized users of the Veeam console do not need to know the password to restore data from encrypted backups. Encryption does not prevent authorized Veeam users from being able to access data stored in backups.

An example is the use of rotated drives for an offsite repository. Because these drives are rotated offsite, they are at a higher risk of falling into the hands of unauthorized users. Without encryption enabled, these unauthorized users could install their own copy of Veeam Backup & Replication and gain access to the stored backups easily.

On the other hand, if the backup files are encrypted, unauthorized users cannot access any data in the backups or even learn any critical information about the backup infrastructure as even backup metadata is encrypted. Without the key used for encryption or access to the original Veeam Backup & Replication console itself, the backup files remain secure.

### How does it work?

When Veeam Backup & Replication reads a block from disk, it compresses the
block (unless compression is disabled at the job level), encrypts it with a
session key generated for that job session, and stores the block into the
backup file. If enabled, they backup file is also encrypted using an additional
key generated by the Password Loss Protection mechanism.

### When to use it?

Backup and backup copy job encryption should be used if backups are transported offsite, or if unauthorized users may easily gain access to backup files in another way than by using the Veeam console. Common scenarios are:

-   Offsite backups to a repository using rotated drives
-   Offsite backups using unencrypted tapes
-   Offsite backups to a Cloud Connect provider
-   Regulatory or policy based requirements to store backups encrypted

Enabling encryption requires an active full backup.

### Best Practices

-   Enable encryption if you plan to store backups in locations outside of the security domain.
-   While CPU usage for encryption is minimal for most modern processors, some amount of resources will still be consumed. If Veeam backup proxies are already highly loaded, take it into account prior to enabling job-level encryption.
-   Use strong passwords for job encryption and develop a policy for changing them regularly. Veeam Backup & Replication helps with this, as it tracks passwords’ age.
-   Store passwords in a secure location.
-   Obtain Enterprise or a higher-level license for Veeam Backup & Replication, configure Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager and connect backup servers to it to enable Password Loss Protection.
-   Export a copy of the active keyset from Enterprise Manager (see
    [User Guide](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/backup/em/em_export_import_keys.html) for more information).
-   Back up the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager configuration database and create an image-level backup of the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager server. If these backups are also encrypted, make sure that passwords are not lost as there will be no Password Loss Protection for these backups.

## Tape Job Encryption

### What does it do?

Similar to backup job encryption, tape job encryption is designed to protect data at rest. These settings protect data if an unauthorized user gains access to tape media outside of the backup infrastructure. Authorized users do not need to know the password to restore data from encrypted tape backups. Encryption does not prevent authorized Veeam
users from being able to access data stored in tape backups.

Typical use case is to protect data on tapes when media is shipped to an offsite location or to a 3<sup>rd</sup> party. Without encryption enabled, a lost tape could easily be accessed, and data stored on tapes could be compromised.

### How does it work?

Data is read from disk, and the session encryption key is used to encrypt data blocks as they are written to tape. Tape encryption can leverage either hardware tape encryption (if present and enabled) or software-based encryption. If the tape drive supports hardware encryption, the session key is sent to the tape device via SCSI commands and the drive itself performs the encryption prior to writing data to tape. This allows encryption to occur with no impact on performance or CPU of the tape server. If the tape hardware does not support encryption, Veeam falls back automatically to using software-based AES 256 data encryption prior to sending it to the tape device.

### When to use it?

Tape job encryption should be used any time you want to protect the data stored on tape from unauthorized access by a 3rd party. Tapes are commonly transported offsite and thus have a higher chance of being lost and turning up in unexpected places. Encrypting tapes can provide an added layer of protection if the physical tapes are lost.

If tape jobs are pushing already encrypted data to tape (for example, Veeam data from backup jobs that already have encryption enabled), you may find it acceptable to not use tape-level encryption. However, be aware that a user who gets access to the tape will be able to restore the backup files. Although this user will not be able to access the backup data in those files, some valuable information, for example, job names used for backup files, may leak.

### Best Practices

-   Enable encryption if you plan to store tapes in locations outside of the security domain.
-   Consider the risks/rewards of enabling tape job encryption even if the source data is already encrypted and decide appropriately for level of risk.
-   Use strong passwords for tape job encryption and develop a policy for changing them regularly (you can use Veeam Backup & Replication password age tracking capability).
-   Store passwords in a secure location.
-   Obtain Enterprise or a higher-level license for Veeam Backup & Replication, configure Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager and connect backup servers to it to enable Password Loss Protection.
-   Back up the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager configuration database and create an image-level backup of the Veeam Backup Enterprise Manager server. If these backups are also encrypted, make sure that passwords are not lost as there will be no Password Loss Protection for these backups.

## Network Transport Encryption

### What does it do?

Unlike the backup and tape job encryption features, the network transport encryption feature is designed to protect data “in-flight”. For example, when the proxy is sending data across the network to the backup repository, the data can be encrypted between these two points even if job-level encryption is not enabled. This is primarily useful when the network between the source and target is not trusted, for example, when sending data across the Internet.

### How does it work?

Network encryption in Veeam Backup & Replication is controlled via the global Network Traffic options.

![Network Traffic Encryption](./encryption_1.png)

Whenever two backup infrastructure components need to communicate with each other over the IP network, a dynamic key is generated by the backup server and communicated to each node over a secure channel. The two components then establish an encrypted connection with each other using this session key, and all communications between these two components for that session are then encrypted with this key. The key is of one-time use and is discarded once the session is complete.

### When to use it?

Network transport encryption should be used if the network between two backup infrastructure components is untrusted or if the user desires to protect Veeam traffic across the network from potential eavesdropping.

By default, Veeam Backup & Replication automatically encrypts communication between two nodes if either one or both has an interface configured (if used or not) that is not within the RFC1918 private address space (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 169.254.0.0/16). Veeam also automatically uses network-level encryption for any connection to a Cloud Connect provider, however Cloud Connect
establishes a TLS 1.2 encrypted tunnel to the service provider.

### Best Practices

- Enable encryption if a possibility of network-level eavesdropping is a
  security concern.
- Network-level encryption can use significant CPU resources, especially on
  the encrypting side (source) of the connection. Make sure
  that component nodes have enough resources[^1].

  **Note:** .
- Use network-level encryption only where required. If backup infrastructure
  components are running on a network that is using non-RFC1918 IP addresses
  but is still private and secure from eavesdropping, consider using the
  following registry key to disable automatic network-layer encryption.

  -   Path: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Veeam\Veeam Backup and Replication`
  -   Key: `DisablePublicIPTrafficEncryption`
  -   Type: REG_DWORD
  -   Value: 1 (_default: 0_)


[^1]: Some newer CPU architectures can offload encryption and reduce the amount
of CPU resources required. For Intel CPUs specifically, you may check your CPU
model on [Intel ARK](http://ark.intel.com/search/advanced/?s=t&AESTech=true)
and look for the "[AES-NI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set)"
capability.
