## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for backup administrators or consultants managing Veeam
Backup & Replication on a daily basis.

Most sections of this guide assume you already have hands on experience with
Backup & Replication, and will serve as an "advanced user guide", meaning
that more basic usage information, system requirements and the like must be
found in [User Guide in Veeam Helpcenter](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/backup/vsphere).

Service providers delivering BaaS and DRaaS with Veeam Cloud Connect should
refer to the corresponding
[Veeam Cloud Connect Reference Architecture](https://www.veeam.com/wp-cloud-connect-reference-architecture-veeam-backup-replication-v8.html).
